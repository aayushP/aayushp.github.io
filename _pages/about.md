I lead the machine learning team within the synthetic data organization at Reality Labs, Meta. My group works on problems at the juncture of machine learning, computer vision and computer graphics. We tackle challenges in domain adaptation, neural rendering and other sim2real problems for mixed reality. Before joining Meta, I was the head of machine learning at synthetic data startup, AI Reverie. Prior to this, I worked at Nvidia where I spent 6 years on synthetic data research in computer vision. While at Nvidia, my group delivered some of the prominent works in synthetic data creation. I graduated with a B.Tech in E&ECE from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, India, in 2010, and MASc in Computer Engineering from University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2013.

<!-- I'm a senior researcher, part of Toronto AI lab, NVIDIA. My research interests lie at the juncture of machine learning, computer vision and computer graphics. Specifically, I work on sim-to-real problems for perception. I want to train effective real world models from simulation. Prior to NVIDIA, I was part of IBM Labs, Toronto, where I worked on *Compilers* - another area I've been interested in the past.
