I'm a senior researcher, part of Toronto AI lab, NVIDIA. My research interests include the juncture of machine learning, computer vision and computer graphics. I specifically work on sim-to-real problems for perception. I want to learn effective real world models from simulation. Prior to NVIDIA, I worked at IBM Labs in a *drastically* unrelated area, Compiler. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, India with a B.Tech in E&ECE in 2010 and from University of Waterloo with an MaSC in Computer Engineering in 2013.
